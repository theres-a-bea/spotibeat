Structure Plan:
Get oAuth token, implement with spotipy API
Query library, import IDs into list (primary key)
Query metadata, store BPM in list in same order so ID position can be used as primary key (i.e: looping i times, query item i in list)
Loop through BPM list, if > than current highest BPM OR < lowest BPM - set var as that, else escape
Calculate difference, divide by 10, create 10 lists and store their max/min BPM
For each ID in list:
    figure out which list it should be in
    amend with ID
Loop through lists
    If <5 entries, merge with next list
Write each playlist to spotify
